Design Story: The CollegeTips Gallery ✨

Hey there! 👋

So you wanna know about why the CollegeTips Gallery looks like a neon dream powered by good vibes and JavaScript magic? Buckle up, friend — it’s story time!

🎨 Why These Colors?

Imagine this: late night brainstorming, lofi beats playing, and I’m sipping on chai wondering, “What feels like college?” The answer? Chaos + creativity + caffeine = **Gradient Galore!**

- 🌌 The deep purples and cosmic blues? That’s the mystery and ambition of student life.
- 🌈 Those smooth transitions and gradients? Just like our college journey — dynamic, unpredictable, and surprisingly beautiful.
- ✨ Sparkles and animations? Because *why not*! Life's too short for boring UIs.

🧠 UX That Feels Like Fun

- Filters? Because we’ve got *moments* and they deserve categories.
- Emojis in buttons? Because this is not a boring corporate gallery. It’s 100% Gen Z certified.
- Full-screen modal with confetti? You click a picture and boom, instant serotonin.

🛠️ Built With:

- HTML + CSS + JS: No frameworks, just raw creative energy.
- Confetti from the JS Gods above (and some math).
- Accessibility because we believe everyone should see the fun.

💡 The Vibe?

Think of this as a mix between a campus fest poster, your favorite photo dump, and a design student’s final year project (but, like, actually finished 😄).

🤔Struggles I faced?
Uhm to be honest nothing, Just chilling with Spotify but only thing i hated is *Spotify Ads*😭


Built with ❤️, color palettes, and pixel-perfect passion by Sharaj MM
